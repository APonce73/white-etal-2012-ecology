Code for replicating the analyses in "Characterizing species-abundance distributions across taxa and ecosystems using a simple maximum entropy model" by Ethan P. White, Katherine M. Thibault, and Xiao Xiao. To be published in Ecology in 2012.

The code and data in this repository allow the analyses in the paper to be fully replicated for four of the six datasets Breeding Bird Survey, Mammal Community Database, Forest Inventory and Analysis, and Alwyn Gentry's Tree Transects). The other two datasets were obtained under agreements restricting the publication of raw data, but simulation results and figures can still be generated for these datasets.

Requirements: Python 2.x and the following Python modules: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mpmath, mete (https://github.com/weecology/METE), macroecotools (https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools). Two additional modules, mpl_toolkits, and mpl_toolkits.basemap, are required for generating the figures.

The analyses can then be replicated by running the following commands from the command line.

Run all analyses and generate figures: python mete_sads.py ./data/ all

Run portions of the analysis pipeline:
Empirical analyses: python mete_sads.py ./data/ empir
Simulation analyses: python mete_sads.py ./data/ sims
Figures: python mete_sads.py ./data/ figs

On Windows ./data/ should be replaced with .\data\ to match the relevant path conventions.

Please note that these analyses involve both a large amount of data and a lot of computational work and therefore take a long time to run. Expect the empirical analysis to take up to a day, and simulations to take up to a week on an 8-core server. Generating figures takes about one hour due to the neighborhood calculations required for the color ramps on the observed-predicted plots.

Data Use: Data is provided in this supplement for the purposes of replication and is not presented in such a way as to be generally useful for additional analyses. If you wish to use these datasets for additional research they should be obtained from relevant data providers. For BBS, MCDB, FIA, and Gentry this can be done automatically by using the EcoData Retriever (http://ecologicaldata.org/ecodata-retriever).
